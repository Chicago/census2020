## The Basics

### What is the Census?
Every 10 years, the United States conducts as “census”, or a count, of the entire population.

### Who gets counted?
The Census counts everyone who lives in the United States, regardless of their immigration or citizenship status. If you live here, you get counted.

### Why do we have a Census?
The data collected from the Census are used to ensure equal political representation and allocation of government resources. Census data determine the number of congressional seats each state receives; the distribution of over $700 billion in federal government resources; and the funding and placement of public services and infrastructure.

### When is the Census?
The U.S. Census Bureau will mail postcards to every household in the United States starting in March 2020. The postcard will request each household to complete the survey by Census Day on April 1, 2020. 

### How can I complete the Census?
You can complete the Census online, by telephone, or by mail. This is the first year the Census will be available online. You can fill out your survey using any Internet-enabled device (cellphone, computer, tablet, etc.). 

## The Questions
### What questions am I going to be asked?
The Census survey will ask the name, sex, age, date of birth, race/ethnicity, and relationship of everyone in your household. It will also ask if you rent or own your home. For more information on what you will be asked on the Census, see the [2020 Census Website]( https://2020census.gov/en/about-questions.html). 
### Will the Census ask for my citizenship status?
The federal government has said it is looking for a way to include the citizenship question on the Census, but many community organizations, states, and municipalities, including Chicago, are fighting in court to stop them. 
### Who should I count in my Census? 
You should count anyone who is living and sleeping in your home most of the time. This includes both related family members and unrelated people, such as foster children, friends, lodgers or live-in employees.  For more information, see the [2020 Census Website] (https://2020census.gov/en/who-to-count.html)
### Are children included in the Census?
Yes! It is important to count any children living in your housing unit most of the time. This includes children who split their time between households, newborn babies, and other children who may live with you like grandchildren, the children of friends, or nieces and nephews. 

## Getting Counted
