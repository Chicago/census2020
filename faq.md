## The Basics
### What is the census?
Every 10 years, the United States conducts a “census”, or a count, of the entire population.
### Who gets counted?
The census counts everyone who lives in the United States, regardless of their immigration or citizenship status. If you live here, you get counted.
### Why do we have a census?
The data collected from the census are used to ensure equal political representation and fair allocation of government resources. Census data determine the number of congressional seats each state receives; the distribution of over $700 billion in federal government resources; and the funding and placement of public services and infrastructure.
### When is the census?
The U.S. Census Bureau will mail postcards to every household in the United States starting in March 2020. The postcard will request each household to complete the survey by Census Day on April 1, 2020.
### How can I complete the census?
You can complete the census online, by telephone, or by mail. This is the first year the census will be available online. You can fill out your survey using any Internet-enabled device (cellphone, computer, tablet, etc.).
## The Questions
### What questions am I going to be asked?
The census survey will ask the name, sex, age, date of birth, race/ethnicity, and relationship of everyone in your household. It will also ask if you rent or own your home. For more information on what you will be asked on the census, see the [2020 Census Website](https://2020census.gov/en/about-questions.html)
### Will the census ask for my citizenship status?
No, the 2020 census will not ask a question about citizenship. The federal government has now been permanently prevented from asking the citizenship question as part of the 2020 census in any form.
### Who should I count in my census response?
You should count anyone who is living and sleeping in your home most of the time. This includes both related family members and unrelated people, such as foster children, friends, lodgers or live-in employees. For more information, see the [2020 Census Website](https://2020census.gov/en/who-to-count.html)
### Are children included in the census?
Yes! It is important to count any children living in your housing unit most of the time. This includes children who split their time between households, newborn babies, and other children who may live with you like grandchildren, the children of friends, or nieces and nephews.
## Getting Counted
### How do I complete the census?
There are three ways you can fill out the census survey: online, by telephone, or by mail. Households can answer the questions on the internet or by phone in English and 12 other languages.
### When should I look for my census invitation in the mail?
Starting in March 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau will mail postcards to every household in the United States. You should receive your postcard by April 1, 2020.

### When can I go online and fill out the census survey?
You will receive a postcard by April 1, 2020 directing you to fill out the census online. At that time, you can go online to complete the census.
### Is there a phone number I can call for help filling out my census?
Yes. You can call the U.S. Census Bureau Call Center: (301) 763-INFO (4636) 
or (800) 923-8282.
### What happens if I don’t respond to the census on time?
If you do not respond to the census by April 2020, you will be mailed a printed questionnaire to return by mail. In May 2020, Census Bureau employees will visit households that have not completed the census to assist you in filling out the census in-person.
### Will a census worker come to my residence?
If your household does NOT submit a completed census survey by the end of April 2020, a Census Bureau employee will visit your residence to assist you in filling out the census in-person. This person will ask you the same questions that will appear in the online version of the census. For more information on Census Bureau employees, see the [2020 Census website]( https://www.census.gov/about/regions/chicago/contact/identify.html)
